# Lambda Functions

Normally, when you write a function in Java, you do in the context of some class.  Such functions are called "methods" and must be called either on an instance object or (more rarely) on the class itself.

It is sometimes useful to have a function that can be called without an object or class.  This is typically because you need to pass the function (reference) as an argument to some method to be invoked later.  With WPILIB, these are commonly used with triggers and commands.

The most common way to create such anonymous functions is using a lambda expression.  This takes an argument list and a value expression, separated by a `->` arrow.  (Compare with the `lambda` keyword in languages like Python.)

```java
// Lambda expression for a function that takes three arguments 
// and calculates their sum
(x,y,z) -> x + y + z
```

Just like in a normal method, the value expression is not evaluated until it the function is actually invoked.

It is also possible to turn any method into a function using the `::` method reference operator.

```java
class MySubsystem ... {
    ...
    boolean hasGamePiece() { ... }
}

// Get an anonoymous function reference with the same arguments 
// and return type.  Use this as a boolean supplier without 
// having to know about the subsystem.
subsystem::hasGamePiece
```

There are some specific types of anonymous function that have special uses: suppliers, consumers, runnables, and callables.  These are actually all classes, but the clever part is that Java will automatically convert anonymous functions into instances of those classes if you use them in the right context.  Suppliers and runnables are often encountered with WPILIB, whereas consumers and callables are not.

## Suppliers

A supplier is a class that supplies values of some specific type when you call the appropriate `getAsX` or `get` method.
It can be created from an anonymous function that takes no argument and returns a value of that type.

```java
() -> subsystem.hasGamePiece() // BooleanSupplier
() -> joystick.getX() // DoubleSupplier
() -> joystick.getX() > 0.0 // BooleanSupplier
```

These suppliers can then be used later to fetch the value:
```java
class ArcadeDrive extends Command {
    DoubleSupplier m_speed;
    DoubleSupplier m_turn;
    DriveSubsystem m_subsystem;

    ArcadeDrive(DriveSubsystem subsystem, 
        DoubleSupplier speed, DoubleSupplier turn) {
        m_speed = speed;
        m_turn = turn;
        m_subsystem = subsystem;
    }

    @Override
    void execute() {
        double drive = m_drive.getAsDouble();
        double turn = m_drive.getAsDouble();
        m_subsystem.drive(drive+turn, drive-turn);
    }
}
```

Unboxed types like `boolean` and `double` have special supplier types like `BooleanSupplier` and `DoubleSupplier` with methods like `getAsBoolean()` and `getAsDouble()` to get the value.
Boxed types are treated differently:
For example, a supplier for `Pose2d` objects would be `Supplier<Pose2d>`, and the accessor is simply `get()`.

Suppliers are a good way to isolate dependencies.  In the code above, `speed` and `turn` probably come from a joystick, but this code doesn't need to know anything about joysticks.  This means that you can change to a different type of joystick or even bring in semi-autonomous "driver assist".

## Runnables

A `Runnable` is a class that has a `void run()` method.
It can be created from an anonymous function that takes no arguments (and any return value is ignored).
In WPILIB, it can be used to create commands on-the-fly using `InstantCommand`, `RunCommand`, `StartEndCommand`, or `FunctionalCommand`.
It can also be passed to many trigger methods (along with a required subsystem).

```java
// This expression can be used as a Runnable
() -> { /* do stuff here */ }
```

## Consumers

A `Consumer` is similar to a supplier but in reverse.
With a `Supplier`, the receiver gets to decide when and how often it is called.
With a `Consumer`, the sender makes those decisions. Instead of having a `get` or `getAs<TYPE>` method, a `Consumer` has an `accept` method.

`Consumer`s are not much used in FRC programmer, but they might be useful in a case where it's important that each value be processed exactly once.
An example of this might be camera frames, or information derived from that such as robot location, or game piece locations.

```java
// Define a type to consume
public record VisionMeasurement(Pose2d pose, 
    double timestamp, Matrix<N3,â€‹N1> stddevs) {}

// Expose a consumer that processes the records
public final Consumer<VisionMeasurement> visionMeasurementConsumer = (vm) -> { 
    m_poseEstimator.addVisionMeasurement(vm.pose(), 
        vm.timestamp(), vm.stddevs()); 
};

// ...

// Somewhere else, pass new records to the consumer
m_visionMeasurementConsumer.accept(
    new VisionMeasurement(pose, timestamp, stddevs));
```

## Callables

A `Callable` is very like `Runnable`, except that it has a `call()` method that returns a value of some type.
(There is also a technical difference in exception handling.)
These are not much used in FRC programming.
