# Suggestions for FRC Safety Captains
In 2020 I was a Safety Manager at a regional.  I participated in pit inspections, interviews, and judging for the safety award.  Here are some suggestions I have for any Safety Captain. These are particularly intended to be a good starting point for someone suddenly appointed as Safety Captain a few weeks before competition who doesn't know how to start.

A team’s safety does not come from one person alone.  There are things the safety captain can do individually, but real success will come from having a team culture of safety, where people know what they have to do to be safe, and feel comfortable reminding each other.  Your team should be appointing a Safety Captain before Kickoff; see if you can make that happen next year.

## Binder
You should have a clearly-labelled and well-organised safety binder in the pit.  This should contain: 
* Relevant **FIRST manuals**, esepcially the Safety Manual and Event Rules.  You may be the only person on the team to read these, so make sure you pass along any relevant information.  Be prepared to demonstrate familiarity with these materials. 
* **Data sheets** for hazardous chemicals (e.g. glue, lubricant, basically any bottles, tubes, or spray cans in the pit).  It’s fairly easy to find these online and print them out. Manuals for tools you brought to the event.  Again, almost every manual can be found online.
* **Team safety manuals** or training materials.  Basic first aid information. How to operate a fire extinguisher (PASS=Pull, aim, squeeze, sweep).  Safety guidelines for outreach events.
* **Pit safety checklist**
* **Event-specific information** such as the nearest emergency hospital
* List of people on the team with **CPR/First Aid training**
* List of people on the team **certified** to operate certain types of machinery
* **Safety event log**.  Safety audit reports.
* Copies of any **posters or flyers** you are handing out.

## General responsibilities at an event

You will be expected to attend daily **Safety Captain meetings**, probably early each morning.  This is a good venue to speak up and raise any questions you may have, offer suggestions, raise general safety concerns, or offer praise.  

At an event, you are also supposed to be a **safety ambassador** for FIRST.  If you see an issue, you should draw it to someone’s attention.  (Be careful if you find yourself in the position of criticizing a specific team.  Remember you can involve one of your mentors.)  Direct people with injuries to the EMT desk at pit admin.  Offer (with any teammates you can gather) to take a turn on the entrance to give the volunteers there a break.

Some specific things judges will look for in a **pit inspection**: First aid kit, battery spill kit, data sheets, daisy-chained power strips, loose hair or clothing, food, any unsafe practices.

At an event, safety judges are also responsible for **event safety**, and they will notice if people are forgetting safety glasses, crowding their pit, playing football in the aisle, transporting a robot improperly (e.g. without human first), or lifting improperly (lift with the knees, not the back).  They will note your team number, even if they don’t say anything.

## Safety Award

The formality of **safety award interviews** varies considerably between events and from year to year.  Often they’re a quick conversation in the pit.  If you are taken for a formal interview, you will almost certainly be allowed to bring a teammate or mentor with you (but you should do most of the talking).  You may be asked if you want to give a short presentation; if you don’t have one prepared, don’t panic, just say “I’d rather just answer questions”. Bring along your safety binder.

If you’re interviewed about safety, resist the temptation to depict the team as having a perfect safety record.  No-one will believe this.  It’s better to be able to talk about how you **deal with the safety issues** that arise.  What does the team do after an injury or a near miss?  Is there a safety event log?  What have you had to change this season to improve safety?

If someone comes to your pit and asks a random team member where the Safety Captain is, what will they say?  (Some teams do very badly at this one.)  This should be covered as part of “judge talking”.  Also, you should have some **visible identification as Safety Captain**, like a button, a cape, a hat (not yellow or orange), or a custom-decorated high-visibility vest (not red).

## Special event activities

A lot of teams have special things they do to demonstrate their commitment to safety.  Some examples:
* Putting up safety posters in other team’s pits and handing out safety flyers.  By all means accept these, but I recommend caution in doing it yourself, unless you are truly going to do a good job of it, as it easily becomes just more trash.
* Videos, websites, apps.  A lot of work but it does impress judges.
* Safety mascots
* Handing out first aid kits or other safety equipment with team logo.
