# FRC tips

In the course of volunteering with an FRC team (and at various events), I see the same problems come around again and again.  Some of them have excellent resources already available to provide help; others take a little digging.

This project is a small collection of tips I've gathered to save redoing the same research effort.  Largely I'm just repeating stuff other people already said.

* [CAN bus](can-bus/): What is my utilization?  How much is too much?  How do I fix it?
* [Ramps](ramps/): How do I stop my robot falling over when they drive too fast?
* [Coast mode](coast-mode/): How do I make my robot stop, stay stopped, but be easy to move?
* [Burnout](burnout/): How do you stop your motors from burning out?

I decided to put this together as a Github repository, partly so I could incorporate code files if I needed to, but mostly to make it easier for others to correct my inevitable mistakes.
